                    <h2>Mock Grant Proposal (PDF)</h2>
                    <p>As my final project for Intro to Professional Writing, I wrote an example grant proposal for a nonprofit organization requesting funding support for a specific project that aligns with the mission statement of the foundation I applied to. This project demonstrated technical skills such as research, organization, and clear communication. Among the different components of the proposal were an introductory memo and a feasibility study, which utilized the skills above.</p>

                    <h2><i>House of Usher</i> Research Paper (PDF)</i></h2>
                    <p>This paper was researched and written as completion of Honors History of Pre-1865 Literature. The research skills I used while writing it were those primarily related to compiling and assessing other scholarly articles, as the subject of my paper has a wide body of work associated with it. This paper also demonstrates my analytical skills relating to literary evaluation and criticism of themes, symbols, and context.</p>

                    <h2>Prison Policy Initiative Research Project (PDF)</h2>
                    <p>To demonstrate the research I did on the Prison Policy Initiative, I assembled this presentation and short overview of the organization. This research was completed for the Integrative Experience course Going to Jail. I focused on analyzing the goals of the organization and the methods used to acheive them, as well as evaluating those goals and methods. I was previously familiar with the PPI as part of my Criminolgy class, so this project built off that previous familiarity. I summarized the group's goals and looked through their website to establish basis for the methods they used, and then assessed them on validity and effectiveness.</p>

                    <h2>HTML Exercises (Webpages)</h2>
                    <p>During the course of my Intro to Web Design class, I produced and submitted a series of HTML pages that showcase different HTML and CSS skills. These pages show proficiency in structuring and styling webpages according to professional standards. These include creating aesthetic, functional, and accessible webpages. These skills are highly transferable and useful in the modern workplace, where web design is only becoming more entrenched in professional settings.</p>

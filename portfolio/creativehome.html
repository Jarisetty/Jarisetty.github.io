                    <h2>Introductory Creative Writing Portfolio (PDF)</h2>
                    <p>This portfolio showcases the most outstanding poems and short-form creative writing pieces that I produced while taking Intro To Creative Writing. These pieces demonstrate my creative and stylistic talent. It comprises a mix of poetry and prose in a variety of styles and genres. During the course, I familiarized myself with different techniques, and have included the best here.</p>

                    <h2>Poetry Portfolio (PDF)</h2>
                    <p>This portfolio is comprised of poetry written during the course of Creative Writing: Fiction, a followup to the intro class which focused specifically on explpring surrealism. I experimented with dynamic form for these pieces, as well as with obscure diction. The collection is an investigation into the evocation of emotion in written word, and includes a short summary and analysis of the writing process.</p>

                        <h2>Style Imitation Letter (PDF)</h2>
                        <p>For the class Victorian Monstrosity, I wrote a creative work in the style of Sheridan Le Fanu's "Carmilla". The process involved close reading of the text and analysing the author's writing style and habits. It also functions as a character analysis, as it is written from the perspective of the protagonist. The project required considerable editing as I worked to make it as true to the original content as possible.</p>

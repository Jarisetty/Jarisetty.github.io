        <p>My name is Jessica Arisetty. I use she/they pronouns and am a junior at UMass Amherst. I am an English major pursuing a certification in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/pwtc/"> Professional Writing and Technical Communication</a> (PWTC), as well as Psychology minor. Iâ€™m interested in literary analysis, especially discussing how evolving symbolism reflects cultural changes. I also study American crime and criminal justice. These areas of interest intersect to support a critical thinking mindset and confronting assumptions about how the world functions, which is crucial to being an informed participant in a modern society where information moves fast and verification becomes an intentional, detailed process.</p>
	<p>To remove the white space below my footer, I added a "wrapper" div class. I made this into a grid and gave the footer the value of "1fr" so it would auto-fill any left over space. Then I set the body margin to 0 to remove the white border around the wrapper. And that's how I cleaned up the white space "gaping"! </p>
        <p>Listed below are a few of my interets.</p>

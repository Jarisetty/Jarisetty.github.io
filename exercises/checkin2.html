		<h1>How To Plan A Tea Party</h1>
<p>So, you and your friends want to plan a delightful tea party. As an experienced planner of aesthetically pleasing events, I will graciously give you a swift lesson on the basics and necessities of planning a smashing tea party (smashing only in the sense of slang, of course! No broken china here).</p>

<h2> Necessities</h2>
<p> Before we can get to the delightful bits, here's what you<strong> absolutely need</strong> to host a successful event.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Guests</li>
<li>Teacups</li>
<li>Food</li>
</ul>
<h3>Guests</h3>
<p>Guests should be easy: simply invite your friends! I suggest doing this at least three months ahead of time, as most likely all of your schedules will conflict to a comically unlikely degree.</p>
<h3>Teacups</h3>
<p>Teacups are easy. Go to your nearest thrift store, remember it's a Sunday and thrift stores are closed on Sundays, and go back on Monday. Then, sweep the contents of the china aisle into your bag. It doesn't matter if it matches, that adds to the whimsicality.My local thrift store is Global Thrift, whose Instagram page you can visit <a href="https://www.instagram.com/global.thrift.store">here</a>. I have acquired quite a pretty collection from them!</p>

<h3>Food</h3>
<p>I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the tea itself, dear reader, but I know how easy it can be to forget about provisions while running around planning. That's why I am graciously providing you with my top three quick n' easy tea party snack recipes.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Finger Sandwiches - <a href="https://cookingforanarmy.com/english-cucumber-sandwiches-crowd/#recipe">These cream cheese and cucumber sandwiches</a> are basically idiot-proof and provide classy, delicious results.</li>
    <li>Scones - You simply <i>must</i> have scones at a tea party! <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/79470/simple-scones/">These scones</a> are straightforward and you can add in dried fruit of your choosing if you're feeling fancy.</li>
    <li>Petits Fours - <a href="https://cookingwithcarlee.com/chocolate-petit-fours/#wprm-recipe-container-27405">These little chocolate bites</a> are a bit more involved and do require lots of cooling time, so I suggest making them the night before or waking up very early.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you've been paying attention, you should now be prepared to throw a tea party with minimal disaster. I believe in you wholeheartedly!</p>

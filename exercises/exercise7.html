            <h2>Mock Grant Proposal (PDF)</h2>
            <p>As my final project for Intro to Professional Writing, I wrote an example grant proposal for a nonprofit organization requesting funding support for a specific project that aligns with the mission statement of the foundation I applied to. This project demonstrated technical skills such as research, organization, and clear communication. Among the different components of the proposal were an introductory memo and a feasibility study, which utilized the skills above.</p>

            <p>This paper was researched and written as completion of Honors History of Pre-1865 Literature. The research skills I used while writing it were those primarily related to compiling and assessing other scholarly articles, as the subject of my paper has a wide body of work associated with it. This paper also demonstrates my analytical skills relating to literary evaluation and criticism of themes, symbols, and context.</p>

            <h2>Presentation on Flute Physics (PDF)</h2>
            <p>For my final assignments in the class Physics of Music, I created and presented my research on the physics of the flute. The presentation includes a brief overview on the historical and cultural background of the instrument. It also includes an explanation of the fluteâ€™s acoustics as well as an analysis of the sound waves it produces. This presentation demonstrates my research ability outside of literary fields, which in turn shows the flexibility of my skills that are typically associated with academic and analytical writing. Furthermore, the visuals of the presentation display my aesthetic and organization prowess.</p>
